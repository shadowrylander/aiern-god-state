* aiern God State

This is an [[https://gitorious.org/aiern/][aiern-mode]] state for using
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode][god-mode]].

It provides a command =aiern-execute-in-god-state= that switches to
=god-mode= for the next command. I bind it to =,=

#+begin_src lisp
  (aiern-define-key 'normal global-map "," 'aiern-execute-in-god-state)
#+end_src

for an automatically-configured leader key.

Since =aiern-god-state= includes an indicator in the mode-line, you may
want to use =diminish= to keep your mode-line uncluttered, e.g.

#+begin_src lisp
  (add-hook 'aiern-god-state-entry-hook (lambda () (diminish 'god-local-mode)))
  (add-hook 'aiern-god-state-exit-hook (lambda () (diminish-undo 'god-local-mode)))
#+end_src

It's handy to be able to abort a `aiern-god-state' command. The
following will make the key unconditionally exit aiern-god-state.

#+begin_src lisp
  (aiern-define-key 'god global-map [escape] 'aiern-god-state-bail)
#+end_src
